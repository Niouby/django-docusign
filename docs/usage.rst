Usage
=====

Configuration
-------------

In your ``settings.py`` :

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # ...
        "django_north",
    ]

    NORTH_ROOT = '/path/to/sql/migrations/')
    NORTH_TARGET_VERSION = '1.42'

Available Commands
------------------

showfixtures
............

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./tests_manage.py showfixtures

List missing fixtures, and print SQL instructions to create them
(ask your DBA team to add a dml migration for that).

"Fixtures" designates here datas which are automatically created by django
on ``post_migrate`` signal, and required for the project.


Basically:

* content types (``django.contrib.contenttypes``)
* permissions (``django.contrib.auth``)

The site id 1 (``SITE_ID`` setting) is not checked by this command.
